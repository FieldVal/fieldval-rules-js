Checks if the value is an object and has the specified fields.

* ```fields``` is an array of rule fields. Every field must have a "name" set.
* ```any``` is a boolean that if set to ```true``` allows the object to have any contents.

```any``` can only be set to ```true``` if ```fields``` is undefined.
